INSTALL MINGW AND CMAKE

1. Install MinGW into $MinGW
   1.1 Install mingw32-base and mingw32-gcc-g++.
   1.2 Append $MinGW/bin to $Path.
2. Install CMake.

INSTALL OPENCV

1. Download and extract OpenCV into $OpenCV_DOWNLOAD.
2. Run CMake with:
   Source dir: $OpenCV_DOWNLOAD/source
   Build dir : $OpenCV_BUILD (e.g. $OpenCV_DOWNLOAD/build/x86/mingw)

   Configure, with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo, and generate.
3. Run "mingw32-make" and "ming32-make install" in $OpenCV_BUILD.
4. Move $OpenCV_BUILD to your final directory $OpenCV (e.g. C:\opencv24)
5. Add $OpenCV to its own Enviroment Variable %OPENCV_DIR% and add %OPENCV_DIR%\bin to %PATH%.

NOTE:
For every project, add the entry "OpenCV_DIR" as %OPENCV_DIR%.

If OpenCV is 2.4, then the following error should appear
   BTNS_AUTOSIZE is not defined
To solve this, modify $MinGW/include/commctrl.h by searching the line /* define _WIN32_IE if you really want to */
and modify the underneath text so it ends been like this:
#if 1
#define _WIN32_IE   0x0500
#endif

INSTALL BOOST

1. Download and extract Boost into $Boost.
2. Run "bootstrap.bat gcc" and "b2 toolset=gcc" to build Boost.
3. Append $Boost to $Path.

NOTE:
For every project, add the entry "BOOST_ROOT" as $Boost.
